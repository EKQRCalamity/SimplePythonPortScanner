# SimplePythonPortScanner
A very simple python port scanner. If you only want to scan in a certain range just change the two range() functions in the for loop on line 32. Default will be 65535 but this might take a long time so I actually recommend only scanning for 1-16k.

## Command line arguments
-h for hostname
-i for IP Address
leave it blank to type in the ip as input
